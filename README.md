# Log Analysis and Threat Detection with ELK Stack

## Objective
Utilizes the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for log analysis, threat detection, and data visualization to identify and respond to security incidents efficiently.

### Skills Learned
- Processing log parsing and ingestion from various sources (Logstash)
- Threat detection via queries and dashboards (Kibana dashboards)
- Analyzing log data to trace security events and discover incidents
- Indexing data and storing it for efficient searching and retrieving for later (Elasticsearch)

### Tools Used
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for log ingestion/analysis.
- Network analysis tools (i.e. Wireshark) for capturing/examining network traffic.
- Generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
