## Objective
Utilizes the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for log analysis, threat detection, and data visualization to identify and respond to security incidents efficiently.

### Skills Learned
- Processing log parsing and ingestion from various sources (Sysmon)
- Detection via queries and dashboards (Kibana dashboards)
- Analyzing log data to trace security events and discover incidents (Using filters)
- Indexing data and storing it for efficient searching and retrieving for later (Elasticsearch)

### Tools Used
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for log ingestion/analysis. (ElasticSearch Cloud)
- Sysmon installation for process creations, network connections, and file change logging.
- Windows and Kibana integrations along with setting up Elastic Agent hosts and policies.
